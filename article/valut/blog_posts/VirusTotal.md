Ah, as always, it's a delicate balancing act between security and convenience. Someone once told me that people can be divided into two types: those who already back up their data and those who will start doing it soon. Losing an important file often serves as initiation into the latter group.

Today, I'd like to gently rephrase this and divide people into two categories: those who already check their files regularly and those who will start doing it soon. Alright, I'm sure the first thought that crossed your mind is, "But it's the 21st century, why should I inspect this manually? I have antivirus software, after all." And to a great extent, you're right. Antivirus programs have become reliable guardians of our device's relative safety.

However, today I'd like to introduce you to a tool that works like a dozen antivirus programs at once and doesn't get in each other's way. A quick nod to those in the know.

## So, what's this all about?

In short? VirusTotal aggregates data from a dozen antivirus engines and enables us to detect malicious code fragments in our files.

## Also, URLs

Got a suspicious link that looks like a redirect, and you don't have a safe environment at hand to check it? Well, I don't have the perfect solution for you, but this website at least allows you to verify whether this link has already been flagged as malicious by the community and where it redirects.

## But I'm too lazy to do this every time.

And here, it's fitting to refer to another quote: "Every one of us at some point in our lives is vulnerable to a cyberattack." Whether it's exhaustion, family situations, or anything that distracts us. Anything can happen. But they also have APIs. I encourage you to read more about it. Explore, discover, and decide. Safe internet browsing is essential.

Feel free to share any additional details or adjustments you'd like!
