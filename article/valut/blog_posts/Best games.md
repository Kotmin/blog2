at least in my opinion

Others

On the internet, "Top 10" and "Top 5" lists are very popular. So, I thought I'd create my own. This time, it's a list of five games that I believe everyone should get to know. Why these? What do I think about them? Well, read on ðŸ˜¸.

## 6. Don't Starve Together

I believe it's the perfect choice for those looking to start their adventure with the Steam game launcher (and not only, although on this platform, spending $5 unlocks the "Steam Marketplace," and buying DST specifically also gets you an additional legal copy for a friend). However, this matter probably deserves its own article. For me, it's a prime example of how an indie game can become popular. Unique atmosphere, timeless graphics, a hidden backstory, and a world that's decidedly against us.

## 5. Stardew Valley

In contrast, pixel art graphics, a rural idyll, and a farm-building simulator. We, former corporate rats, inherit our grandfather's farm and begin building a strawberry empire, for example. I've spent hundreds of hours on this game, even some of them with friends. When I think about it, I start to miss it. Maybe it's time to return to that farm?

### Don't think that hardcore gamers won't find anything here ðŸ˜¸. Dungeons, intricate puzzles, and fishing are waiting for you. Plus, the Prairie King minigame.

## 4. Chrono Trigger

The first and probably the only full RPG on this list. Don't be fooled; it's one of the best representatives of the genre. Greetings to Golden Sun 2, the new Zelda, Skyrim, and The Witcher series ðŸ˜¸. If the graphics don't convince you, newer titles like The Witcher 3 should satisfy you.

## 3. Grand Theft Auto V

Okay, who hasn't heard of this? Cool multiplayer? Check. Intriguing storyline? Check. Released on almost every platform? Check. Definitely a game for mature players, and it's most enjoyable when playing with friends or on roleplay servers. But it couldn't be left off my list.

## 2. Minecraft

In contrast, fun for everyone. The basic version not enough for you? Get some mods. Tired of mods? Join online servers. Had enough of people and longing for tranquility? They've already added something to the basic version that will allow you to enrich a new world. A game with truly enormous creative possibilities. At the moment, its versions are divided into "Java Edition" and "the other one." The first one is more associated with modding, but read about it yourself. My role is just to draw your attention to this title. Spoiler: it's worth it ðŸ˜¸.

## 1. League of Legends

Some love it, some hate it. My adventure with it has been going on for more than 10 years. I was initially drawn in by the character design and lore, but it was the gameplay and friends that kept me. There's something magical about this title, without a doubt. Because it's not just any multiplayer game. Staying at the top of the rankings requires much more than just luck, and League of Legends has it. Alert: some say this community is exceptionally toxic. Well, there are such people, but you're more likely to encounter them in ranked matches. So, my fervent plea is, give it your all and "never surrender."

Perhaps some of you have reached this point in the article with the question, "Why didn't you mention ...?" You can insert any title here. There are plenty of noteworthy games; that's what makes this adventure so fantastic. I personally love titles released exclusively for the 7th generation of consoles. Nevertheless, I haven't included any of them on this list. Why? Because some warm memories are mine and mine alone. I could add games like Warcraft 2, Warcraft 3, The Settlers, Diablo II, Baldur's Gate, Cyberpunk 2077, old Blade Runner 2077, Titanfall, or the XCOM series here. However, I wanted to focus on games that will appeal to the majority. I understand that some might be put off by the titles mentioned earlier, but somewhere deep in their gaming hearts, we know they'd also have a great time with these titles ðŸ˜¸.

Feel free to share any additional details or adjustments you'd like!
