<h2>Starting from the Very End.</h2>
<p>Oh, how I'd love for a Senior Developer to cast their eyes upon this code. But, let's go back.</p>
<p>I've set some specific goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want good, reusable code.</li>
<li>Code that won't become obsolete too quickly.</li>
<li>It should be readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that might sound a bit high-flown. But now, for some important organizational matters we'd like answers to. We know we're working in the terminal, and we want to have at least a two-player mode. It would be great if you could play against the computer.</p>

<p>Hey, classic tic-tac-toe is fun, but what if we go further? So, let's add another requirement. Local multiplayer. A player vs. the computer? - Of course. A player, their buddy, and the computer on the same board? - Challenge accepted.</p>
<p>The idea from the beginning was this: we want to use a concept like server and client. The board handles the game's logic. The player is a semi-abstract interface that, in short, allows us to interact with the board. Well, later it turns out that being a semi-interface is equivalent to a "players" list.</p>

<h2>Our Very Own AI!</h2>
<p>While our artificial intelligence might sound like a lofty concept, it's essentially random. It may sound trivial, but in practice, it can comfortably be labeled as the "easy" level, ensuring fun for the average player ðŸ˜¸.</p>
<h2>The code</h2>
<p>Here's a glance at the game's storyline, written directly in code.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>One thing I can see that could be improved - UX!!! It's simple, but sometimes I think it could provide more information. Like an additional mesh with column names and a few other things.</p>
<p>Adding players manually, well, it's a bit cumbersome.</p>
<p>Perhaps adding some safeguards would be wise.</p>
