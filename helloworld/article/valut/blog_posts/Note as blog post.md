## How does it started?
It took a while before I've convicted myself to use different app for making notes (ofc other that the simplest notepad üê±). Once upon a time I felt a need to have my notes synchronized and accesible from every device and place the word. I didn't heard about some magic like clouds, shared storage or NAS. I made not so broad research and i FOUND IT - Microsoft One Note. And thats how that note making journey began.

A few years later, few applications later i shipped to the port with the flag Obsidian.md. And we're here ...

```Python

def __start__(init_value: int):
	return log(f(x)**POWER)



if __name__ == '__main__':
	dont_worry_be_happy('happy now',)


```
